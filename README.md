## Hello

IB.ai is the bot developed for the [International Baccalaureate (r/IBO)](https://discord.gg/ibo) server, by the community.
It is a free and open source project, released under the GNU GPL version 3.
You are welcome to install/run/use/contribute to the project yourself, however, keep in mind that it is tailored for the IB server.
We try our best to document everything in the [project wiki](https://github.com/ib-ai/IB.ai/wiki).
If there is anything missing, we encourage you to help keep it up to date.

## Technologies & Philosophies

IB.ai is currently written purely in Java, and employs various different technologies. We use:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to containerize our application and seamlessly provide DevOps functionality.
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) in order to utilize Spring, which allows us to cut down boilerplate and focus on business logic.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as an incredibly powerful database server to effectively store our data with stellar performance and reliability.
- [Discord4J](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J) to provide an excellent wrapper for the Discord REST and gateway API.

We believe it is important to write beautiful, tested software. 
Instead of re-inventing the wheel, we rely on existing technologies that allow us to achieve our goal of non-tedious and non-over-engineered code.
While the learning curve with this stack may be a little steep sometimes, we believe that these technologies are fundamentally important and are worth investing time and effort into.

## Installation

We do not provide a public version of the bot for everyone to use.
If you want to use IB.ai, you must install and run it yourself!
The installation process differs, depending on if you just want to run IB.ai or whether you are developing for it.
If you want to...

#### ...just run IB.ai

If you want to just run IB.ai, you can follow the [deployment](https://github.com/ib-ai/IB.ai/blob/master/DEPLOYMENT.md) guidelines.
They contain step-by-step instructions on how to run our production builds of IB.ai under your own bot account.

#### ...make code changes or develop IB.ai
